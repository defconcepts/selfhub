# SelfHub #

Data: for the people, by the people.
  
## Summary ##
SelfHub is a central platform for sharing and analyzing quantified-self data. Users can contribute to ongoing studies by uploading anything from step count information passively collected by Fitbit to any kind of data they collect on their own.
  
## Problem ##
There are plenty of apps for gathering all kinds of data about ourselves, but there is currently no central platform for making this data openly available to the quantified-self / research community at large.

## Solution ##
SelfHub lets people set up their own schemas with tools for collecting and analyzing data, as well as visualizing the results. The quantified-self community now has the power to situate their own personal data within a broader global context.

## Customer Quote ##
> I've been living on Soylent for several months now and have collected lots of personal health data: weight, heart rate, blood glucose, etc. I was pleased to find hundreds of others on SelfHub who already contributed similar data to a user-created-schema. The visualized aggregation has been extremely informative. I have a much clearer picture of how healthy I am compared to other Soylent drinkers.

## Call to Action ##
Research should be for you, me and everybody.
