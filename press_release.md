There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows. 

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

Data: for the people, by the people.
  
## Summary ##
SelfHub is a central platform for sharing and analyzing quantified-self data. Users can contribute to ongoing studies by uploading anything from step count information passively collected by Fitbit to any kind of data they collect on their own.
  
## Problem ##
There are plenty of user apps for gathering all kinds of data about ourselves, but there is currently no central platform for making this data openly available to the quantified-self / research community at large.

## Solution ##
SelfHub lets people set up their own schemas with tools for collecting and analyzing data, as well as visualizing the results. The quantified-self community now has the power to situate their own personal data within a broader global context.

## Quote from You ##

## How to Get Started ##
  1. Register
  2. Find or create schemas to contribute to
  3. Start tracking your data
  4. Upload!

## Customer Quote ##
> I've been living on Soylent for several months now and have collected lots of personal health data: weight, heart rate, blood glucose, etc. I was pleased to find hundreds of others on SelfHub who already contributed the similar data metrics to a user-created-schema. The visualized aggregate data have been extremely informative. I have a better picture of how healthy I am compared to other Soylent drinkers.

## Call to Action ##
Research should be for for you, me and everybody.
